Sentiment Analysis on Customer Reviews: Selection of the Best Feature Engineering and Machine Learning Models for Sentiment Prediction Problem

Abstract

This empirical research aimed to find the best feature engineering and machine learning algorithm in predicting sentiment from customer reviews. 
Combinations of four feature engineering methods with several of the most popular algorithms were tested; 
ensemble learning techniques as well as neural network were also tested and the results were then compared with base models. 
Results showed that the base models have already achieved superior predictive power. 
For the ensemble models, we found that stacking using Decision Tree and Logistic Regression as base models and KNN as meta model produces the best result. 
Multiple strategies for converting customer ratings to the customer sentiment target column were also investigated and discussed.

This group project (Nov 2018- Jan 2019) was for one of our machine learning courses.
